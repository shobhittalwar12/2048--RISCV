This RISC-V assembly implementation of the 2048 game simulates gameplay on an m×n board (default 4×4) using the RARS simulator. The game logic follows standard 2048 rules: tiles shift in the chosen direction, merge when equal, and a new tile (2 or 4) appears after each valid move. The board is stored as an array of 16-bit halfwords in row-major order, and all moves are normalized to "left" via board rotation. The code is modular, with each subroutine (e.g., move_one, merge, complete_move, check_victory, etc.) handling a specific task like shifting tiles, checking possible moves, or placing new tiles.

Gameplay is controlled from main.s, which runs the game loop: reading input, executing moves, printing the board, and checking for victory or game over. After each move, the board updates, a new tile is placed using place.s, and the score is adjusted. Win detection is done by check_victory.s (looking for a 2048 tile), while loss detection checks if any moves remain using move_check.s. Input is handled via memory-mapped I/O, and the board is printed to the console in a formatted grid.
